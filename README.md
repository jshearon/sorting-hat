# Sorting Hat

An exercise that sorts an array of students for either Hogwart's school, or Voldemort's evil army. Student names can be added, and are automatically assigned to a random house. When a user clicks the `Expelliarmus` button, that students card is moved and sorted with the Voldemort's evil army cards.
